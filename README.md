# pokedex

Pokedex allows users to search for Pokemon by name or number and view search results in either a list or grid view. You can do an advanced search and filter results that way, as well. Users can click on individual Pokemon to go to their profile and see individual stats. You can also add Pokemon to the "My Favorites" page.
